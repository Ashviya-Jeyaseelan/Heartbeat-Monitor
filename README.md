# Heartbeat Monitor
The Heartbeat Monitor Project is a project that I designed that seamlessly integrates electrical and biomedical engineering. Using an Arduino programmed in C++, your heartbeat is displayed onto a liquid crystal display (LCD) with a synchronous flashing LED upon placing your thumb on the pulse sensor. 

Created for McMaster Engineering's Venture Academy, the Heartbeat Monitor project was instructed to 150+ students, exposing future leaders in engineering to electronics and circuitry.
